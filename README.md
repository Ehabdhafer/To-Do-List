# To-Do-List

## Introduction ðŸ––

#### I've built a dynamic Laravel app that seamlessly manages to-do lists in real-time, leveraging OTP, Redis for caching, and Pusher for live notifications. With React powering the frontend, it delivers a fluid user experience, ensuring efficient task management with added security and responsiveness.

## Installation ðŸ’½

Laravel :

```bash
- cd server
```

```bash
- composer install
```

```bash
- php artisan migrate
```

```bash
- php artisan serve
```

React

```bash
- cd client
```

```bash
- npm i
```

```bash
- npm start
```

### Inserting in database:

```
- create 2 roles manually from database put this query:
- INSERT INTO roles (role)
  VALUES ('admin'),('user');
```

```
- create at least 1 admin manually from database put this query:
- INSERT INTO users (name, email, password, role_id)
  VALUES ('John Doe', 'johndoe@example.com', 'password123', 1);
```

### Navigate to dashboard:

- login from admin account then go to
  http://localhost:3000/dashboard
