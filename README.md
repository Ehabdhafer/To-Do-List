# To-Do-List

## Introduction ðŸ––

#### I've built a dynamic Laravel app that seamlessly manages to-do lists in real-time, leveraging OTP, Redis for caching, and Pusher for live notifications. With React powering the frontend, it delivers a fluid user experience, ensuring efficient task management with added security and responsiveness.

## Installation ðŸ’½

Laravel :

```bash
cd server
```

```bash
composer install
```

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

```bash
php artisan serve
```

React

```bash
cd client
```

```bash
npm i
```

```bash
npm start
```

### Inserting in database:

```
create 2 roles manually from database put this query:
INSERT INTO roles (role)
  VALUES ('admin'),('user');
```

```
create at least 1 admin manually from database put this query:
INSERT INTO users (name, email, password, role_id)
  VALUES ('Ehab Abed', 'ehab@gmail.com', 'ASAXas4335@#@#', 1);
```

## Navigate to dashboard:

- login from admin account then go to
  http://localhost:3000/dashboard

## Notification:

- Notify the user when an admin assigns a task to them or deletes a task.
- Notify the user when they add, update, or delete a task for themselves.
